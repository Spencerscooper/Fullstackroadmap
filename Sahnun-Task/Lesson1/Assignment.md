## Compiled VS Interpreted
<p>This assignment cover 2% percent
on my understand from what has been researched about Compiled and Interpreted.
These two are key to programming base on what programming language you are using. Python and Javascript which I m a bit familiar with uses interpreted during code execution or invocation. It's import to the lanague because those two language read code line by lines and terminate if an error is on the next lines in summary interpreted language work like a pattern in python called short circuit, which work like this a using a condition statement (if) and a logical statement (and, or, not) In this case I'm sure interpreted will evualate like this before the code process. if 4 > 1 and 2 < 5 run this code. If those two does not match show me a syntax errors. In case this the program render an error doing execution</p>

## As for compiler
<p>The program will run the entire code and failed to produce result if the program has a syntax error. This situation I m optimistic that debugging is challenges because you have to read and evualate each code line by lines.</p>

##Note
<p>This a big topic and require constant reading to understand these two fully.</p>
